# RexAI on Hugo

Welcome to the website of RexAI, a website which I designed for my Cybersecurity AI-based startup concept in my CIS 3500 class at the University of Pennsylvania. This project involves developing a valuable real-world skill: building a scalable and cost-effective website from scratch using Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator.

This is an iteration of my previous website, but I have now implemented a Github workflow using tools provided to us in class to autodeploy my website as well as host it on an external domain. You can see it hosted live on GitHub Pages via a custom domain from Namecheap [here!](https://rexcloud.ai).

## Learning Objectives

- Work in public, understanding the scrutiny this may invite.
- Quickly familiarize with new web development tools and technologies.
- Ramp up on unfamiliar codebases and technologies through self-directed research.
- Gather functional requirements and draft user stories.
- Develop UI/UX design skills through customization of page layouts and themes and use of DALL-E/other generative AI technologies.
- Gain experience with static site generators and Jamstack technologies.
- Validate designs and functional requirements through prototyping and iteration.
- Publish and host static websites on GitHub Pages.
- Communicate technical concepts through writing and illustration.
- Collaborate through version control and managing shared repository workflows.
